# Write Your Own Shell in Rust

## Introduction

One of the things developers use every day is a [shell](https://multicians.org/shell.html). It comes in many flavors like `bash`, `fish` or `zsh`. Depending on your background, writing your own shell from scratch might either sound intimidating or pointless. We like to believe that it can be a fun way to gain more hands-on Rust experience. If you want to play with concepts like I/O, error handling, and syscalls we invite you to participate in this workshop. Who knows, it could also be an opportunity to start your first mid-size Rust project?

> [!NOTE]
> Shells are very complex and we will only implement a basic subset of their functionality.
> Take this workshop as an excuse to learn Rust rather than a guide for how to write the perfect shell.

## Who's the Target Audience?

This workshop is intended for *intermediate* Rust programmers who already understand basic Rust concepts and have some programming experience. Weâ€™ll explain the rest as we go along.
When we were learning Rust, we always wanted to see a mid-size system being built to get an understanding of how the concepts are put into practice. We think this could be a learning boost for people who are in the same situation as we were.

### Necessary Tools

* [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Structure

Every commit adds one new feature or refactors the code in a significant way.
You can `git checkout <commit_id>` to see what the code looks like after each step.

You can always check your implementation by running `./validate`.

(Validate script was adapted from the majestic [build-your-own-shell](https://github.com/tokenrove/build-your-own-shell) by Julian Squires.)

## Features We Cover

1. Running single commands
2. Concatenating commands with semicolon
3. Shell-builtins (`cd`)
4. Pipes
5. Ideas for extending your shell
   - readline
   - handling control signals (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd>)
   - redirection
   - command completion
   - adding more builtins
   - use a grammar for parsing
   - Hints for the workshop

### Block 0 - Check Rust Installation and Version

Run `rustc --version`.
You should see something like `rustc 1.74.0 (79e9716c9 2023-11-13)`.

### Block 1 - Running Single Commands

- Try to run a single command and print the output to the stdout.
- Hint: Use [Command](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html) from the standard library.
- Bonus: Try to make the code as idiomatic as you can.
- Bonus: Write a unit test to make sure your shell works.

### Block 2 - Concatenating Commands

- Try to run two commands in sequence and print all output in sequence
  to `stdout`.
- Bonus: Write an [integration test](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/testing/integration_testing.html).

### Block 3 - Builtins

Builtins are commands, that are implemented inside the shell itself (so, literally "built in").
They serve common needs that most users will have, like printing things with `echo`.

- What would be a nice way to handle builtins?
- Implement a builtin of your choice (e.g. `exit`, `echo`, `cd`, 
  `for`,...).
- Bonus: Think about why `cd` must be a builtin.

### Block 4 - Shell History

- Add support for the `history` command, which lists all previously executed commands.
- Bonus: Think of other ways to store the history (e.g. in a database).

### Block 5 - Pipes

- Implement pipes, which are a way to feed the output of one command into another one.
	Syntax:

	```shell
	command1 | command2
	```

- Bonus: Think about ways to make command representation more idiomatic.

### Block 6 - Bring your own features (e.g. "where the fun is at")!

* Add readline support
* Handle control signals (ctrl+c, ctrl+d)
* Redirection
* Command completion
* Implement more shell-builtins
* Use a grammar for parsing
* Add more tests
